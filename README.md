# projet-ionic-games

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 12.2 and Ionic 6

## Video Games Collection
This project presents a video games collection in the form of collectible cards linked to a firebase.
It is the ionic version of Angular project, just to show some differences between the two versions.

a form permits to add new cards
but an empty card cannot be added thanks to disabled submit button for empty fields. 

Two ways to sort data for client have been implemented:

a search filter by keywords
a select box with options to filter results: alphabetically, by dates, by rating,etc

Photos can be taken on the fly thanks to @capacitor/camera, a console message confirms it.
A service has been added for Ionic 6 capacitor storage on homepage just to show how it works!
