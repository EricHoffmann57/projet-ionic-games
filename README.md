## Video Games Collection
This project presents a video games collection in the form of collectible cards linked to a firebase.
It is the ionic version of Angular project, just to show some differences between the two versions.

a form with required fields permits to add new cards
an empty card cannot be added.

Two ways to sort data for client have been implemented:

a search filter by keywords
a select box with options to filter results: alphabetically, by dates, by rating,etc

Photos can be taken on the fly , a console message confirms it.
A service has been added for Ionic 6 capacitor storage on homepage just to show how it works!
